# Lambda-Chess

A very simple chess engine implementation in Haskell. 
This implementation doesn't meant to be a competetive product, I do it only to learn haskell. 
It's main purpose is not performance, but code readability. 

## Build
The project uses the stack build tool (which uses cabal under the hood), so in order to build the project you only need to execute:
```stack build```

## Run
To run it, just execute ```stack exec hs-chess-exe```
